I have to admit, with all the hype and 5 star positive reviews I have heard of this buffet (from friends, peers and other reviews) there was a heck of a lot to live up to. The result? Two thumbs up of approval. Absolutely AMAZING.\\nUpon entrance, I was blown away by the decor. Stunning. The restaurant utilizes glassware for much of their decor, which made for contemporary, yet comfortable ambiance, garnished with an array of the most appetizing dishes I have ever seen at a buffet - and I have been to many around the USA, especially buffets in Las Vegas.\\nI sampled everything. Starting with the Chinese food to the Mexican Sope (stuffed with zucchini flower and cheese) these were incredible - I could have eaten THREE.

And to top it off the whole experience is just waiting from the time you sign in to the time you pay, to the time you wait to be seated.Great were Inside the buffet starving after all that waiting well suprise!!! There is still long wait time at the popular selections Seafood,meat section. Like a previous person wrote its honestly just something to cross off your bucket list.

Prior to our trip, we researched all the different places we wanted to try during our trip and this place was at the VERY top of our list. \\n\\nBacchanal buffet is located inside Caesar's palace and it is one of the most expensive buffets on the strip. Not to mention one of the most popular. If you don't get there early enough, you will wait over 200 minutes or pay an expensive fee to \"skip the line\".\\n\\nWe arrived at 4 for dinner. Dinner is served between 3-10 I believe and from what the cashier said, the busiest times were between 6-9. Boy was she wrong. Upon arriving, we checked into the kiosk to get a place in line and the kiosk gave us a return time of 219 minutes.. around 7:30. It also gave us the option to skip the line now for $35 per person. \\n\\nBecause this was a new experience for us, we said eff-it, and paid the express fee.

I loved the beets and their oyster shooters were delightful. \\nThey have a whole breakfast section with red velvet pancakes, waffles and chicken, churros, and so much more.  You have to try the churros because they were the best churros I have ever tried. They were warm and melted in my mouth. \\nThe best part was their sweets! The dessert bar was hard to find.

We chose Bacchanal and it did not disappoint. Although there was no crab of any kind so that was a bummer. We came for the weekday brunch on a Tuesday morning around 9am. Adults was $39.99 (ouch). Unsure about the kids. This was the biggest buffet I've ever seen. Seafood has shrimp cocktail, smoked mussels, etc. then there was the carving area with ham, sausages. There was chicken &amp; waffle, steak n eggs, bagels, breads, Mexican, fresh juices, Italian with lasagna &amp; bread, sushi (I didn't care for it at all), dim sum, Chinese food, dessert bar was on point. We were so stuffed!!! The selection was overwhelming but delicious. We walked right up, no wait at all. Awesome! This will be hard to beat. We were debating between this one and the Wicked Spoon at the Cosmo. This one was pretty darn good.</td>\n",

This place can be packed, but it's definitely worth it if you come hungry -- which you should considering the price and obviously a buffet.\\n\\nThey have a vast amount of offerings and are sectioned based on types of food such as seafood, Chinese, Mexican, Italian and all sorts of meats. What really stood this place out from the rest are their selection of meats. From ribeye, tri-tip steak, beef wagu, pork belly, etc...I enjoyed them. For the most part, their offerings are decent. I enjoyed their gelato, but was not a fan of the rest of their desserts. That's ok though. \\n\\nIf you have the time and money, I say at least check this one out.

While this is a bit early, I highly recommend coming during brunch time because there won't be a line, there will be alot less people there, and it's almost half the price for full dinner and you still get premium items like snow crab and rock crab. \\nThe decor is very modern and pretty, I love the patterned glass inside the restaurant. The food selection is incredible, they have everything from king crab legs, scallops, shrimp, duck, pasta, steak, sausages, and gelato! They almost have orange juice, cucumber juice (pretty gross) and watermelon juice (fantastic!)\\nThey also have a large dessert selection and just too much food to try them all. \\nI don't think I would pay the dinner price to come eat here but the brunch deal is a steal!</td>\n",

Instead there is only snow crab legs, and when I asked for King crab legs, I was told that the snow crab was better and the crab legs came in a mixed box, so I had to take what was out on the buffet.  Tell me why King crab sells for 3 times more on the outside if it is not as good as snow crab? Most of the food looked like it was out for quite awhile. I will never go here again, even if it's free,  Total RIP OFF. I don't understand the current reviews.  I think they have changed how they are doing business, and just trying to make as much profit as they can by serving cheap substitutes.</td>\n",

It did not disappoint. My friend got a receipt from the kiosk earlier during the day and we came back around 4:30. We probably waited around 15 minutes. Not bad at all. When we left the line was huge. I'd highly recommend doing a \"linner\" (lunch/dinner) and going around 4-4:30 to avoid the crazy lines. By the time you get in and get all your food, you'll be hungry. \\n\\nI started with the seafood and got some shrimp as well as some sweet potato tater tots while my friends went all out with the crab legs. The tater tots weren't very warm though which was kinda a bummer. My second plate consisted of Chinese food, mashed potatoes and Mexican corn, sushi and different types of cheeses. I almost didn't have enough room for dessert. I got some macaroons and a cake pop. Unfortunately there was no room left in my s...</td>\n",

However, they were super salty and had no sweetness to them at all. Rest of the seafood such as oysters, sea snails, stone crab claws, and cioppino were only decent. Lamb chops and bone marrow were good but not spectacular like many reviews said. The Asian food section had Peking duck, Korean BBQ ribs, Char Siu, and roast pork. Also tasted just ok.

       "0     I'm staying at Caesar's Palace for 4th of July weekend and today was my very first time visiting the long anticipated Bacchanal Buffet. I have to admit, with all the hype and 5 star positive reviews I have heard of this buffet (from friends, peers and other reviews) there was a heck of a lot to live up to. The result? Two thumbs up of approval. Absolutely AMAZING.\\nUpon entrance, I was blown away by the decor. Stunning. The restaurant utilizes glassware for much of their decor, which made for contemporary, yet comfortable ambiance, garnished with an array of the most appetizing dishes I have ever seen at a buffet - and I have been to many around the USA, especially buffets in Las Vegas.\\nI sampled everything. Starting with the Chinese food to the Mexican Sope (stuffed with zucchini flower and cheese) these were incredible - I could have eaten THREE. Next was the Wagyu Beef, Brisket, and the Suckling Pig - not fatty, full of meat, skin was cripsy - perfectly done and the chef on the...   \n",

We heard great things about this buffet and was not disappointed! Italian, sushi, American, Spanish all great! Didn't even make it to the dessert bar or seafood but left full and happy. Everyone on the group had different favorite bites making it a great option for groups with different tastes. Line wasn't crazy. Maybe waited 10 minutes, if that. Service was attentive and friendly!   \n",

If your down you can choose to have bottomless mimosas to quench your thrist! The waiter was spot on with keeping my glass filled!  Best advice I can give try not to over load your plate so you can try everything!   \n",

I have definitely gotten sick off the oysters and cocktail shrimp on two separate occasions eating here. Also for the price its definitely not worth it. While the selection of desserts is very good, the rest of the food isn't that great. A lot of the food is over cooked to the point where it is soggy or not fresh. I would go with another buffet like Wicked Spoon or even the Bellagio buffet.   \n",

       "6     Heard lines were pretty long here and we were hoping we wouldn't be another victim as we came here for dinner on a Wed night.  They cashier said the wait would be 45 mins-1 hr but we ended up waiting for 30. We thought we could do the 24 hr Buffet Pass which included Caesars (at additional cost on top of set price) and other buffets along the strip but heard that we would be paying more since we came during dinner. We passed on that and just bought dinner at regular price (around $50) which is pretty pricey.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is very intimate, fancy furnishings and dim lighting.  Like other buffets, Caesars had a variety of different cuisines: Asian, American, Mexican, Italian and of course dessert! Their seafood bar had Alaskan crabs, scallops, clams, crawfish, shrimp and oysters and more..\\n\\nI really enjoyed the lasagne and the seafood bar mostly.  The desserts were pretty good, they even had a crepe bar! \\n\\nFor the food and quality, I thought the price is pretty  steep!...   \n",

Non stop .As far as the food not impressed at all. I was expecting great quality food since the Dinner price was $54.99 per adult.They dont have a big selection at all. And to top it off the whole experience is just waiting from the time you sign in to the time you pay, to the time you wait to be seated.Great were Inside the buffet starving after all that waiting well suprise!!! There is still long wait time at the popular selections Seafood,meat section. Like a previous person wrote its honestly just something to cross off your bucket list. Food is not good at all,Honestly dont know how it is the \"Best\" buffet.My favorite is still the Rio Buffet.   \n",

       "12    Hubby and I visited Vegas during independence weekend (2017) and made plans to try bacchanal buffet. Prior to our trip, we researched all the different places we wanted to try during our trip and this place was at the VERY top of our list. \\n\\nBacchanal buffet is located inside Caesar's palace and it is one of the most expensive buffets on the strip. Not to mention one of the most popular. If you don't get there early enough, you will wait over 200 minutes or pay an expensive fee to \"skip the line\".\\n\\nWe arrived at 4 for dinner. Dinner is served between 3-10 I believe and from what the cashier said, the busiest times were between 6-9. Boy was she wrong. Upon arriving, we checked into the kiosk to get a place in line and the kiosk gave us a return time of 219 minutes.. around 7:30. It also gave us the option to skip the line now for $35 per person. \\n\\nBecause this was a new experience for us, we said eff-it, and paid the express fee. For my hubby and I, our total tab to enter was ...   \n",

       "15    Best Buffet in Vegas! Sets itself apart from the others. We purchased the buffet of buffets pass and paid the additional to eat here for dinner one night. This was for sure the best meal in the 24 hours. We had dinner the night before and then breakfast, waiting until about 7:30pm to make sure we were our hungriest! It was a splurge.. and I would probably skip the 24 hour pass on my next visit and only visit Bacchanal. This food had much more flavor than the other buffets, better and more high end options. I think my boyfriend and I shared at least 3 plates of crab legs, snow, king and steamed. ALL delicious! There is sushi, pho and ramen. There are all the options of a steakhouse. The desserts are truly amazing, I got pretty much one of everything and had a bite of each. I was hoping to have room for the crepes.. but just didn't make it lol \\n\\nService was good, drinks were brought and refilled quickly.

Tried to explain to her that we were waiting in line for 45 mins, after being told to do so by the gentleman who also worked at the buffet, she ignored and cut me off. I attempted again and she says \"you'll have to wait in line again.\" It would be understandable if she acknowledged that if was a mistake by another employee but ignored everything. Customer service doesn't work that way. If you are in a bad mood or has had a bad day you should be able to not allow it to show or should not work directly with customers. \\n\\nThe food was great so this one star is strictly towards Marta's customer service and the the person(s) in charge of staffing that department.   \n",

I thought the cold ones tasted better and were less salty than the heated ones. They had crab claws which were not good. I would recommend you save your stomach for something else. I thought the claws had a interesting texture and flavor.\\nAfter I stuffed myself with the seafood, I tried their food. I loved the beets and their oyster shooters were delightful. \\nThey have a whole breakfast section with red velvet pancakes, waffles and chicken, churros, and so much more.  You have to try the churros because they were the best churros I have ever tried. They were warm and melted in my mouth. \\nThe best part was their sweets! The dessert bar was hard to find. It was secluded on the right side of the buffet. When you got there, there were so many desserts to pick from. My favorite was the coconut tapioca pudding and...   \n",

My daughter was drooling from the pics so we decided we had to take the kids to a buffet before we leave Vegas. We chose Bacchanal and it did not disappoint. Although there was no crab of any kind so that was a bummer. We came for the weekday brunch on a Tuesday morning around 9am. Adults was $39.99 (ouch). Unsure about the kids. This was the biggest buffet I've ever seen. Seafood has shrimp cocktail, smoked mussels, etc. then there was the carving area with ham, sausages. There was chicken & waffle, steak n eggs, bagels, breads, Mexican, fresh juices, Italian with lasagna & bread, sushi (I didn't care for it at all), dim sum, Chinese food, dessert bar was on point. We were so stuffed!!! The selection was overwhelming but delicious. We walked right up, no wait at all. Awesome! This will be hard to beat. We were debating between this one and the Wicked Spoon at the Cosmo. This one was pretty darn good.   \n",

Or you pay $25/person to cut through all of that.  For me, it took about nearly 2 hours.  I guess the wait times are pretty typical for a Vegas buffet. This place can be packed, but it's definitely worth it if you come hungry -- which you should considering the price and obviously a buffet.\\n\\nThey have a vast amount of offerings and are sectioned based on types of food such as seafood, Chinese, Mexican, Italian and all sorts of meats. What really stood this place out from the rest are their selection of meats. From ribeye, tri-tip steak, beef wagu, pork belly, etc...I enjoyed them. For the most part, their offerings are decent. I enjoyed their gelato, but was not a fan of the rest of their desserts. That's ok though. \\n\\nIf you have the time and money, I say at least check this one out. I don't think you can go wrong with this buffet.   \n",

For a buffet that boasts itself as the best buffet in the world.  The size of the buffet is relatively small and the breakfast option are nothing exquisite.  I walked around and tried to convince myself I was missing more areas of food.  Not worth the cost even for Las Vegas standards.  Service was good but the size and availability of the buffet lines and food selection only merits 2 stars at best.   \n",

       "27                                   This was probably the most kick ass buffet with the most selection I have ever seen before. Me and two other friends went during 4th of July weekend when they had $40 brunch deal (normally $45) if you arrive before 9:30am. While this is a bit early, I highly recommend coming during brunch time because there won't be a line, there will be alot less people there, and it's almost half the price for full dinner and you still get premium items like snow crab and rock crab. \\nThe decor is very modern and pretty, I love the patterned glass inside the restaurant. The food selection is incredible, they have everything from king crab legs, scallops, shrimp, duck, pasta, steak, sausages, and gelato! They almost have orange juice, cucumber juice (pretty gross) and watermelon juice (fantastic!)\\nThey also have a large dessert selection and just too much food to try them all. \\nI don't think I would pay the dinner price to come eat here but the brunch deal is a steal!   \n",

The meats were all burnt and over cooked, there were no wagyu sliders as advertised,  I had to ask for then and a chef opened a drawer, pulled out a pan with a couple dozen of them,  took off the ceran wrap and placed one in a small plate and gave it to me. Clearly they aren't that fresh and ontop of all that,  it was severely undercooked and cold. Even our waiter told us we should not eat it. Dessert selection was subpar, Wynns buffet has more desserts. \\n\\nOverall it seems the buffet scene is dead in Vegas, quality is down everywhere,  your better off spending your money on one nice fancy dish!   \n",

I usually don't care for buffets what so ever but the quality of food is off the chart.  The only downside is that it is a bit expensive and the line to get in is ridiculous.  We had to wait 2.5 hours just to get in.  Not fun when your hungry.  They have added a new check in system but it still sucks because I saw people skip the check in and get in line.  I've been here 5-8 different times and its the same every time.  Staff is slow and your going to have to wait a long time.  That being said.. I always go back because it is really good..   \n",

Disappointed!\\nI researched this place getting all hyped up on the 5 star rating and reviews on how great and awesome the food and place was. I expected sooo much especially when I paid $126 for two.. I also got a great review of this place by Mike Chan on YouTube. \\nFolks it is nothing like what it stated on YouTube and 5 star bull.. you better be a VIP guess to receive good service at all time and the food is a disappointment. I should have complained but I decided not too because this is my opinion and my thoughts. The king crab is super salty and small amount of meat. The crab claws taste like nothing and the Dungeness crab it was ok. The oyster had too much sand inside.. \\noverall this place is not worth $126 for two. I rather go to Jackson Casino buffet for half the price for seafood and I I get lobster.\\n Folk...   \n",

I heard raved reviews of this place from my girlfriend so I was willing to wait to get in for 1 1/2 hours.  The food was a total disappointment,  old and stale food, poor wait service, long lines.  They were suppose to offer king crab legs!  Instead there is only snow crab legs, and when I asked for King crab legs, I was told that the snow crab was better and the crab legs came in a mixed box, so I had to take what was out on the buffet.  Tell me why King crab sells for 3 times more on the outside if it is not as good as snow crab? Most of the food looked like it was out for quite awhile. I will never go here again, even if it's free,  Total RIP OFF. I don't understand the current reviews.  I think they have changed how they are doing business, and just trying to make as much profit as they can by serving cheap substitutes.   \n",
       "1370  I don't think I've ever eaten as much in my life as I did here last Saturday. I've been wanting to try a Vegas buffet for awhile and heard that the Bacchanal was one of the best. It did not disappoint. My friend got a receipt from the kiosk earlier during the day and we came back around 4:30. We probably waited around 15 minutes. Not bad at all. When we left the line was huge. I'd highly recommend doing a \"linner\" (lunch/dinner) and going around 4-4:30 to avoid the crazy lines. By the time you get in and get all your food, you'll be hungry. \\n\\nI started with the seafood and got some shrimp as well as some sweet potato tater tots while my friends went all out with the crab legs. The tater tots weren't very warm though which was kinda a bummer. My second plate consisted of Chinese food, mashed potatoes and Mexican corn, sushi and different types of cheeses. I almost didn't have enough room for dessert. I got some macaroons and a cake pop. Unfortunately there was no room left in my s...   \n",
       "1371  Just want to be clear the only reason why this place is getting five stars is because of Julie P. She redeemed this restaurant from being rated a three-star restaurant. \\n\\nLet me help you understand... first impressions are everything. It doesn't matter if you're meeting the president or a homeless person. It truly does matter.  I came with a group of girls and found an awesome deal on Groupon that not only help to skip the lines but also free champagne and a discounted price.  The front of house service manager not only had an attitude but continue to glower at my girlfriends and I for a reason that is unbeknownst to us. We were properly dressed and we were cute in coordinating floral outfits. She continue to look at us like we were hookers in nipple covers and a G string.  \\n\\nAt the end of the day Julie Pea saved the customer service fiasco.

       "1373  This is the gold standard of buffets in Las Vegas. It has a huge selection of meats, food, desserts, Asian section, etc. I was pleasantly surprised how extensive the Asian section was even though it wasn't authentic or the best Asian food out there. The thing is that they have a passable quality with the amount of food choices that they are churning out.\\n\\nI was able to enjoy myself with a wide variety of foods and even pho was available, which is very rare for a buffet. I also had the shrimp dumplings, which are usually only seen in dim sum places. They had smoked salmon and shrimp cocktail. They had a carving station. I remembered getting a plate and as we walked to the end of the first line, we realized another room with more food. This was the moment that I realized that this place was huge!\\n\\nI really enjoyed myself here and wished I could come back to try their food.

The hostess walked us through their wait time process so we hung around the casino before returning less than an hour later.

I really enjoyed the hot king crab legs although I wish they had lobster. My group ended up staying through lunch and into dinner time where we got to see the menu change!

I didn't expect world class sushi, but I expected better than sushi from TI or The Mirage buffets.  Especially after paying $40 a head.  Overall, the hot food is on par with a buffet that is half the price.  On the plus side, the desserts were pretty good and the juices were fresh squeezed - cucumber, carrot, watermelon, orange.  Considering the high price, mediocre hot food, pretty good desserts, and really nice juices, overall 2- stars.   \n",

I often go to dim sum places in SoCal with my sister so I know how dumplings are supposed to look and taste like. When I bit into this particular one, the pork filling was undercooked and still pink.

This delusional lady with an accent on YouTube that reviews buffets mentioned that she thought Studio B buffet rivals that of Ceasars.

       "1382  As far as buffets go, this one was good. That's really not my issue with Caesar's Palace Bacchanal Buffet. They had hot and cold crab legs, they had nice brisket, prime rib, and turkey. They had a variety of stir fry Asian food as well as a modest sushi bar. They had a variety of deserts. Basically, it was your standard buffet you would find just about anywhere you go. \\n\\nSo what sets the Bacchanal Buffet apart from the rest? \\n\\nTHE PRICE. \\n\\nReally. That's it. The price. Over $50 for what I typically get at a $20 buffet anywhere else in the country, and no, this isn't just \"Well, that's Vegas\" because there were plenty of other establishments that had $25 buffets, and some even cheaper that had just as good a quality of a spread. \\n\\nIf I had paid $25 or even $30 for this buffet, this would be a 4 or 5 star review.

However, you can get those at a traditional Dim Sum joint for a fraction of the cost of this place.\\n\\nOn top of that, it's a long wait and \"cattle call\" to get in this place.

       "1384  Definitely the largest buffet I have every been to! The selection was AMAZING - they have everything you can think of (all kinds of meat, seafood, dim sum, tacos, fresh squeezed juices, and more). But unfortunately, the quality of the food did not live up to the number of options. There were some dishes that were well-made, and the number of choices made it easy to find things that each of us enjoyed eating, but for the most part, everything was just mediocre. \\n\\nThe service was quite good though; we had our drink orders taken immediately after getting seated and our plates were continuously cleared throughout our meal. However, the long wait time to enter the buffet was paired with a long wait time for food items inside the buffet. Upon several occasions of reaching the front of the long lines, I was informed that they no longer had the item(s) that I was waiting for. Kind of a disappointment! However, it seemed as though other items were constantly being replenished so perhaps t...   \n",
       "1385  Hands down the best buffet I've been to! There are tons of options and the food is all really good quality! The whole buffet is split into sections, from asian fusion to southern to italian to mexican to seafood (ugh I'm getting hungry just thinking about it). The only issue I had was that I didn't have enough room in my stomach for all of the food I wanted to eat! All of the food I tried was delicious but some of the stars were the crab legs, a truffle pizza dish, and the dessert (made to order crepes and little molten chocolate tarts yum). I especially loved just being able to walk around and try small portions of all of the food, since there was not a shortage of decadent looking options. While the buffet is pricey ($50 on weekends), you can definitely get your money's worth. Plus, it is only $15 to add bottomless mimosas!\\n\\nThe only issue I had was that my waitress was so busy that she didn't refill our mimosas as much as I would have liked. However, she made up for it by lett...   \n",
       "1386  Big disappointment.  I read plenty of reviews on Vegas buffets before choosing to dine here a few weeks ago. There was a huge selection of food but the taste of the food was mediocre at best. No king crab legs that I expected. Snow crab legs were served warm and cold and they had lots of them. However, they were super salty and had no sweetness to them at all. Rest of the seafood such as oysters, sea snails, stone crab claws, and cioppino were only decent. Lamb chops and bone marrow were good but not spectacular like many reviews said. The Asian food section had Peking duck, Korean BBQ ribs, Char Siu, and roast pork. Also tasted just ok. The stir fry dishes looked horrible, old and dried up so I didn't even bother to try them. Spanish fare station, same pots of food there for the duration of our meal. Looked old and unappetizing. Obviously, hardly anyone went for it. Italian station, food looked fresh but again tasted ok only including the Osso Bucco. Dessert station had made to or...   \n",

       "1390  Went here with my girlfriend and spent $114 for 2 of us to eat. When we went to be seated we were seated at a normal table about 6 inches away from another couple and we were probably in the worst seats in the whole place. The seats looked very nice but we were in a bad spot. Not to mention our waiter was very bad...he never came until the end as we had to stack the plates up ourselves and he came to fill our drinks twice out of about an hour and a half... only when we barely saw him and asked. The food was great and tasted great! Some food was cold though but I didn't mind too much. The cleaning lady wiping down the counters there was extremely rude to my girlfriend and I. She was wiping down the counters when my girlfriend and I were getting some food. She literally stood there staring at my girlfriend in here face with this very rude look until she made my girlfriend move and she wiped it down and she then stopped and stared at me until I had to move around her... that's just ri...   \n",
       "1391  For $55/person, I'm not totally convinced it's worth it, but that's just a personal opinion. I can't usually eat too much in one sitting anyway so buffets in general are not appealing.

They had bottomless mimosas for $10 extra. \\n\\nThings that stood out:\\nLong line, long wait. We were there for an hour before being seated. A woman mentioned we could pay to hold our place in line? Not sure if that's even a thing, but we didn't do it. \\nThey had crab legs! They were sliced in half to avoid all the hard work of cracking into them, and you could literally slide out the big meat pieces. So yummy!\\nNo other dishes that really hit the spot.

The food is always fresh and restocked (is that how it's referred as?). There's not an 'endless' selection of dishes like some other buffets because they focus on making their selected dishes great. They have a big seafood selection so it's a shame I don't like fish or oysters. However the crab legs and shrimp are delicious. It can get busy so try to avoid normal lunch and dinner hours. We got there at 2:30p and there wasn't a wait.   \n",

In the middle of our dinner, a couple with a toddler was seated next to us.  As we were finishing our dinner, I noticed a one inch cockroach moving towards the foot of the Mother.  I quickly warned her and the waiter quickly stepped on it and had one of the managers talk to her.  The entire time, she was talking to that family and not a single comment to us!  Maybe she thought it didn't affect us?!?! Seriously!?!? She had her back to us and was either pretending nothing happened or didn't think it was pertinent to us.  We were two feet away!  We were at the end of the dining experience so we left with no acknowledgement from the management or apology whatsoever.  Food was above average (but not excellent) but we were dismayed at how it was handled.

It also gave us the option to skip the line now for $35 per person. \n",

For my hubby and I, our total tab to enter was $227. $69 per person for dinner and $35 per person to skip the line. After paying, we were seated within 5-10 minutes. Not bad. Our hostess walked us to our table but unlike the other guests, she did not explain the different buffet sections. So, shame on her. \n",

The steamed crabs is in that section and if you've ever been to bacchanal, you'll know that the cold seafood section at the front of the restaurant is the most packed section.

The other desserts are not worth getting - save yourself the pain. I tried the tiramisu and the tapioca, among many others, and those two were the stand out worst.

Same thing for The Chinese food station. The meat station was not great as well. But the seafood station is decent. There's a variety of seafood to choose from, e.g. lobsters, king crab legs, oysters, scallops, etc. The dessert bar has a lot to choose from as well. Truffle mushroom soup was a hit for me. I also liked the ice cream bar. They have both classic and unique ice cream flavors. Loved the lemon basil and rum ones. Give this buffet a try if you're a seafood and dessert lover.

Their little pancake plates were so yummy. The texture was perfect for mini things. The steak and eggs was sooo good! Fried chicken and waffles was.... idk I didn't try it but babe took a picture of me with it (cause they are very picture worthy). The ramen broth was DELICIOUS.

Hot crab legs were OK from a flavor standpoint, but despite being precut, harvesting the meat was a little tricky. Hamburger sliders in several flavors fared a bit better, with good flavor and tender rolls for buns. Some of the presentations made it tricky to get the food to your table - are you supposed to dump the tots from the little basket onto your plate, or take the basket? \n",

      "Another surprise dish was corn on the cob in the elotes (Mexican street corn) style, something I hadn't seen before, but it tasted nice, with a creamy sauce and nice crumbles of hard cheese. \n",

      "Perhaps the biggest surprise of all was a small creme brulee that I sampled from the dessert bar; I'm ordinarily very skeptical, as many crimes are committed against this dish at even high end restaurants, but since I saw them being hand caramelized right behind the display, I had to try. It was really good, with the perfect creme texture, not too gelatinous, not too stiff, and nicely creamy. The sugar top had a nice crunch and complemented the custard well. \n",

      "Unfortunately, the price here, even considering that it's Vegas, compared to the overall quality of the food, is what brings this review down to three stars. Yes, there were some winners, but many of the dishes were simply average. This was the only buffet we tried on this visit, and my last Vegas buffet was eight years ago, so I don't really have much to compare it to. Your mileage may vary, though - read some other reviews and decide for yourself if you want to give it a try.\n",

       "\"I'm staying at Caesar's Palace for 4th of July weekend and today was my very first time visiting the long anticipated Bacchanal Buffet. I have to admit, with all the hype and 5 star positive reviews I have heard of this buffet (from friends, peers and other reviews) there was a heck of a lot to live up to. The result? Two thumbs up of approval. Absolutely AMAZING.\\nUpon entrance, I was blown away by the decor. Stunning. The restaurant utilizes glassware for much of their decor, which made for contemporary, yet comfortable ambiance, garnished with an array of the most appetizing dishes I have ever seen at a buffet - and I have been to many around the USA, especially buffets in Las Vegas.\\nI sampled everything. Starting with the Chinese food to the Mexican Sope (stuffed with zucchini flower and cheese) these were incredible - I could have eaten THREE. Next was the Wagyu Beef, Brisket, and the Suckling Pig - not fatty, full of meat, skin was cripsy - perfectly done and the chef on the meat station was a hoot! Ended the meal with an awesome selection of desserts. The dessert station - my favorite - where do I even begin? (salivate salivate) Most of the buffets in Vegas I've eaten at are overly sweet and taste like they've come out of a box. The desserts here are spot on. Gelato and Ice Cream selection is excellent. Some of the best ice creams I have ever tasted - lemon basil sorbet- heart heart. Rice pudding was refreshing and tart. The coconut macroons, Good Lord. For the holiday weekend they even decorated some of the desserts with little flags - super patriotic and thoughtful.\\nOverall, I give this buffet 5 stars, A+++. Service was spot on as well, Super attentive. \\nGreat attention to detail. \\nIf you want a great meal, great dessert, and great service hit the Bacchanal. My only gripe was that the wait was long to get in, but 100% worth it.\""

We then had some dim sum (very very good), Ribs, mac and cheese, Jamaican beef patties, crab, mussels, you name it it's there!!

It's about $59/person for dinner..and if you want unlimited alcoholic beverages, that would be an extra $15. The seafood bar is the highlight of this buffet. With a huge supply of crab legs, crab claws, oysters, shrimps, clams. This was where we spent the majority of our time! My other favorite part of this buffet is the dessert bar! Many different treats from gelato, cheesecake pops and chocolate mousse to freshly made crepes and soufflés, you're bound to find a dessert that you'll like. They also have a sugar free section.\n",
